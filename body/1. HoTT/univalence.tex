As mentioned in the introduction, HoTT builds on top of MLTT by identifying paths between types $A =\U B$ with equivalences $A \simeq B$. We make the identification by first defining a map in one direction:

\begin{lemma}[\cite{program_homotopy_2013}, 2.10.1]
    For any types $A,B$, there is a function
    $$\ide : A =_\U B \to A \simeq B$$
    defined by path induction.
\end{lemma}

From there, Univalence appears as an axiom:

\begin{axiom}[\cite{program_homotopy_2013}, 2.10.3]
    For all types $A,B : \U$, the function $\ide$ is an equivalence.
\end{axiom}
