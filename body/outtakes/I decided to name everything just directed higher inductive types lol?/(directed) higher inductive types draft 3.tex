\subsection{Introduction}
In type theory, the basic object of study is the type. Sitting at the lowest level, we can specify types whose \textit{points} are freely generated by a list of constructors - these types are aptly named \textit{inductive types}. From these inductive types, we can form sections to come to the notion of dependent products, or we can ask what type they live in to arrive at universes. We can also extend the notion of the inductive types themselves, allowing constructors to specify \textit{paths} in the type, not just points to get \textit{higher inductive types}. In a directed setting, the notion of a \textit{directed} higher inductive type should correspond to the notion of a \textit{category} (with some extra work). That is, certain directed higher inductive definitions of types satisfy the \textit{Segal} property.

\subsection{Unit}
We begin by defining the type Unit, which only has one constructor:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\star\,: \ $Unit
\end{itemize}
Abstractly, this should be the type generated by a single point. By definition, we can always form the morphism $\id{\star} : \ho[\text{Unit}]{\star}{\star}$. We expect, though, for there to be no more information than we put into the type. So, the identity should be the only morphism of the unit type.
\begin{lemma} For all $ \normalfont f : \ho[\text{Unit}]{\star}{\star}$,
\[ f = \id{\star}\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For all $x : \mathbbm{2}$, we have that $f(x) = \star = \id{\star}(x)$. By functional extensionality, $f = \id{\star}$.
\end{proof}
The unit type corresponds to the category with one object and one morphism (the identity).
\subsection{I}
The free category with a arrow $I$, is generated by the following constructors.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0_I$
    \item $1_I$
    \item $\seg : \ho[I]{0_I}{1_I}$
    \item $\text{is-segal}(I)$
\end{itemize}
We then check that the positive description of the type is enough to ensure that the type actually models the free category with an arrow. To start, we check that the only morphisms starting from $0_I$ are the identity morphism and $\seg$.
\begin{lemma}
\[
\prod_{x:I}\ho[I]{0_I}{x}\text{ \emph{is contractible}}
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    By Lemma 3.11.6 in HoTT book, it suffices to show that each fiber of $\lambda x. \ho[I]{0_I}{x}$ is contractible. So, we first define a map $$\text{center} : \displaystyle \prod_{x:I}\ho[I]{0_I}{x}.$$
    which gives the center of contraction for each fiber as follows:
    \begin{align*}
        &center(0_I) = \id{0_I}\\
        &center(1_I) = \seg\\
        &center(\seg) = \land_\seg
    \end{align*}
    It then suffices to inhabit the type
    $$\prod_{x:I}\prod_{f:\ho[I]{0_I}{x}}f=\text{center}(x).$$
    Since $\lambda x.\ho[I]{0_I}{x}$ is covariant, by lemma 8.26 of RS17, $$\lambda x. \lambda f.f = \text{center}(x):\displaystyle \prod_{x:I}(\ho[I]{0_I}{x} \to \mathcal{U})$$
    is also covariant. Thus, by theorem 9.5 of RS17, (the dependent yoneda lemma), to exhibit such a type we can give an inhabitant of $\id{0_I}=\text{center}(0_I) \equiv \id{0_I}$, of which $\refl{\id{0_I}}$ suffices.
\end{proof}
We can similarly characterize the morphisms ending at $1_I$. 
\begin{lemma}
\[
\prod_{x:I}\ho[I]{x}{1_I}\text{ \emph{is contractible}}
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Just as in Lemma 2, we define a map $$\text{center} : \displaystyle \prod_{x:I}\ho[I]{x}{1_I}.$$
    which gives the center of contraction for each fiber as follows:
    \begin{align*}
        &center(0_I) = \seg\\
        &center(1_I) = \id{1_I}\\
        &center(\seg) = \lor_\seg
    \end{align*}
    It then suffices to inhabit the type
    $$\prod_{x:I}\prod_{q:\ho[I]{1_I}{x}}q=\text{center}(x).$$
    Just as in the last lemma, to exhibit such a type we can give an inhabitant of $\id{1_I}=\text{center}(1_I) \equiv \id{1_I}$, of which $\refl{\id{1_I}}$ suffices.
\end{proof}
Assuming the covariance of one type family allows us to fully characterize the morphisms of $I$:
\begin{lemma}
    Given a covariant type family $$\emph{code} : I \to \mathcal{U_{\emph{cov}}}$$
    defined as
    \begin{align*}
        &\emph{code}(0_I) = \emph{void}\\
        &\emph{code}(1_I) = \emph{Unit}\\
        &\emph{code}(\emph{\seg}) = \emph{duahom(!)}
    \end{align*}
    then
    $$\ho[I]{1_I}{0_I} \cong \emph{void}$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let  $f : \ho[I]{1_I}{0_I}$. Since code is covariant, there exists a term 
$$\text{cov-code}(f, \star) : \sum_{v : \text{void}}\ho[\text{code}(f)]{\star}{v} \text{ is contractible}.$$
So, $\pi_1(\text{cov-code}(f,\star)):\text{void}$ and we are done, since we have a map abort : void $\to \ho[I]{1_I}{0_I}$ that makes this an equivalence.
\end{proof}
