In type theory, the basic object of study is the type. Sitting at the lowest level, we can specify types whose \textit{points} are freely generated by a list of constructors - these types are aptly named \textit{inductive types}. From these inductive types, we can form sections to come to the notion of dependent products, or we can ask what type they live in to arrive at universes. We can also extend the notion of the inductive types themselves, allowing constructors to specify \textit{paths} in the type, not just points to get \textit{higher inductive types}. In a directed setting, the notion of a \textit{directed} higher inductive type should correspond to the notion of a \textit{category} (with some extra work). That is, certain directed higher inductive definitions of types satisfy the \textit{Segal} property.
