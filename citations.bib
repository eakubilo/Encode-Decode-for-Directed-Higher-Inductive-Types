In this setting we show how to construct a universe that classiﬁes the CohenCoquand-Huber-Mörtberg (CCHM) notion of ﬁbration from their cubical sets model, starting from the assumption that the interval is tiny—a property that the interval in cubical sets does indeed have.

	abstract = {The notion of a universe of types was introduced into constructive type theory by Martin-Löf (1975). According to the propositions-as-types principle inherent in type theory, the notion plays two roles. The first is as a collection of sets or types closed under certain type constructions. The second is as a set of constructively given infinitary formulas. In this paper we discuss the notion of universe in type theory and suggest and study some useful extensions. We assume familiarity with type theory as presented in, for example, Martin-Löf (1984). Universes have been effective in expanding the realm of constructivism. One example is constructive category theory where type universes take the roles of Grothendieck universes of sets, in handling large categories. A more profound example is Aczel’s (1986) type-theoretic interpretation of constructive set theory (CZF). It is done by coding ϵ-diagrams into well-order types, with branching over an arbitrary type of the universe. The latter generality is crucial for interpreting the separation axiom. The introduction of universes and well-orders (W-types) in conjunction gives a great proof-theoretic strength. This has provided constructive justification of strong subsystems of second-order arithmetic studied by proof-theorists (see Griffor and Rathjen (1994) and Setzer (1993), and for some early results, see Palmgren (1992)). At present, it appears that the most easily justifiable way to increase the proof-theoretic strength of type theory is to introduce ever more powerful universe constructions. We will give two such extensions in this paper. Besides contributing to the understanding of subsystems of second-order arithmetic and pushing the limits of inductive definability, such constructions provide intuitionistic analogues of large cardinals (Rathjen et al, in press). A third new use of universes is to facilitate the incorporation of classical reasoning into constructive type theory. We introduce a universe of classical propositions and prove a conservation result for ‘Π-formulas’. Extracting programs from classical proofs is then tractable within type theory. The next section gives an introduction to the notion of universe. The central part of the paper is section 3 where we introduce a universe forming operator and a super universe closed under this operator.},

This concept has significant applications both within mathematics -- where it allows for synthetic (higher) category theory -- and programming languages -- where it leads to a directed version of the structure identity principle. In this work, we construct the first types in simplicial type theory with non-trivial homomorphisms. We extend simplicial type theory with modalities and new reasoning principles to obtain triangulated type theory in order to construct the universe of discrete types \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\$. We prove that homomorphisms in this type correspond to ordinary functions of types i.e., that \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\$ is directed univalent. The construction of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\$ is foundational for both of the aforementioned applications of simplicial type theory. We are able to define several crucial examples of categories and to recover important results from category theory. Using \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}\$, we are also able to define various types whose usage is guaranteed to be functorial. These provide the first complete examples of the proposed directed structure identity principle.},

	abstract = {Directed type theory is an analogue of homotopy type theory where types represent categories, generalizing groupoids. A bisimplicial approach to directed type theory, developed by Riehl and Shulman, is based on equipping each type with both a notion of path and a separate notion of directed morphism. In this setting, a directed analogue of the univalence axiom asserts that there is a universe of covariant discrete  brations whose directed morphisms correspond to functions—a higher-categorical analogue of the category of sets and functions. In this paper, we give a constructive model of a directed type theory with directed univalence in bicubical, rather than bisimplicial, sets. We formalize much of this model using Agda as the internal language of a 1-topos, following Orton and Pitts. First, building on the cubical techniques used to give computational models of homotopy type theory, we show that there is a universe of covariant discrete  brations, with a partial directed univalence principle asserting that functions are a retract of morphisms in this universe. To complete this retraction into an equivalence, we re ne the universe of covariant  brations using the constructive sheaf models by Coquand and Ruch.},

	abstract = {The field of directed type theory seeks to design type theories capable of reasoning synthetically about (higher) categories, by generalizing the symmetric identity types of Martin-Löf Type Theory to asymmetric Hom-types. So far, the main approaches to directed type theory proceed in a “somewhat indirect” manner: axiomatizing the directed interval type and defining the machinery of directed type theory in terms of it. In this paper, we take the first step towards a ‘directed homotopy type theory without the directed interval’ by developing a directed analogue of Hofmann and Streicher’s groupoid model—the category model. The directed type theory this models is adequate for synthetic 1-category theory; the extent to which this approach extends to higher dimensions is the subject of ongoing investigation. Moreover, since the semantics of this theory are expressed in terms of categories with families, these results promise to interface elegantly with current research into generalized algebraic theories and (higher) observational type theory.},

The homomorphism type former is meant to capture the notions of morphism (from the theory of categories) and directed path (from directed homotopy theory) just as the identity type former is known to capture the notions of isomorphism (from the theory of groupoids) and path (from homotopy theory). Our main result is an interpretation of these homomorphism types into Cat, the category of small categories. There, the interpretation of each homomorphism type homC(a, b) is indeed the set of morphisms between the objects a and b of the category C. We end the paper with an analysis of the interpretation in Cat with which we argue that our homomorphism types are indeed the directed version of Martin-L¨of’s identity types.},

However, all of the major implementations lack powerful extensionality principles for reasoning about equality, such as function and propositional extensionality. These principles are typically added axiomatically which disrupts the constructive properties of these systems. Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types (HITs). This paper describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of HITs. These new primitives allow the direct deﬁnition of function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types, all with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types. The adoption of cubical type theory extends Agda with support for a wide range of extensionality principles, without sacriﬁcing type checking and constructivity.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries have been made connecting abstract homotopy theory and the field of type theory from logic and theoretical computer science. This has given rise to a new field, which has been christened "homotopy type theory". In this direction, Vladimir Voevodsky observed that it is possible to model type theory using simplicial sets and that this model satisfies an additional property, called the Univalence Axiom, which has a number of striking consequences. He has subsequently advocated a program, which he calls univalent foundations, of developing mathematics in the setting of type theory with the Univalence Axiom and possibly other additional axioms motivated by the simplicial set model. Because type theory possesses good computational properties, this program can be carried out in a computer proof assistant. In this paper we give an introduction to homotopy type theory in Voevodsky's setting, paying attention to both theoretical and practical issues. In particular, the paper serves as an introduction to both the general ideas of homotopy type theory as well as to some of the concrete details of Voevodsky's work using the well-known proof assistant Coq. The paper is written for a general audience of mathematicians with basic knowledge of algebraic topology; the paper does not assume any preliminary knowledge of type theory, logic, or computer science.},

However, more sophisticated results in fields from algebraic topology to theoretical physics, where objects have "higher structure," rely on infinite-dimensional categories in place of \$1\$-dimensional categories, and \${\textbackslash}infty\$-category theory has thusfar proved unamenable to computer formalization. Using a new proof assistant called Rzk, which is designed to support Riehl-Shulman's simplicial extension of homotopy type theory for synthetic \${\textbackslash}infty\$-category theory, we provide the first formalizations of results from \${\textbackslash}infty\$-category theory. This includes in particular a formalization of the Yoneda lemma, often regarded as the fundamental theorem of category theory, a theorem which roughly states that an object of a given category is determined by its relationship to all of the other objects of the category. A key feature of our framework is that, thanks to the synthetic theory, many constructions are automatically natural or functorial. We plan to use Rzk to formalize further results from \${\textbackslash}infty\$-category theory, such as the theory of limits and colimits and adjunctions.},

There has been considerable interest in internalizing aspects of these presheaf models, either to make the resulting language more expressive, or in order to carry out further reasoning internally, allowing greater abstraction and sometimes automated verification. While the constructions of presheaf models largely follow a common pattern, approaches towards internalization do not. Throughout the literature, various internal presheaf operators (\${\textbackslash}surd\$, \${\textbackslash}Phi/{\textbackslash}mathsf\{extent\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Psi/{\textbackslash}mathsf\{Gel\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Glue\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Weld\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{mill\}\$, the strictness axiom and locally fresh names) can be found and little is known about their relative expressivenes. Moreover, some of these require that variables whose type is a shape (representable presheaf, e.g. an interval) be used affinely. We propose a novel type former, the transpension type, which is right adjoint to universal quantification over a shape. Its structure resembles a dependent version of the suspension type in HoTT. We give general typing rules and a presheaf semantics in terms of base category functors dubbed multipliers. Structural rules for shape variables and certain aspects of the transpension type depend on characteristics of the multiplier. We demonstrate how the transpension type and the strictness axiom can be combined to implement all and improve some of the aforementioned internalization operators (without formal claim in the case of locally fresh names).},

These rules are justified by Martin-Lof’s meaning explanations, which extend the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation of connectives to a rich collection of types, and therefore provide a constructive realizability interpretation of formal proofs.  Around 2005, researchers noticed that the rules of type theory also admit homotopy-theoretic models, and subsequently extended type theory with constructs inspired by these models: higher inductive types and Voevodsky’s univalence axiom. Although the resulting homotopy type theory has proved useful for homotopy-theoretic reasoning, it lacks a constructive interpretation.

On the one hand, Voevodsky's subtle and beautiful "univalence axiom" implies that isomorphic structures can be identified. On the other hand, "higher inductive types" provide direct, logical descriptions of some of the basic spaces and constructions of homotopy theory. Both are impossible to capture directly in classical set-theoretic foundations, but when combined in homotopy type theory, they permit an entirely new kind of "logic of homotopy types". This suggests a new conception of foundations of mathematics, with intrinsic homotopical content, an "invariant" conception of the objects of mathematics -- and convenient machine implementations, which can serve as a practical aid to the working mathematician. This book is intended as a first systematic exposition of the basics of the resulting "Univalent Foundations" program, and a collection of examples of this new style of reasoning -- but without requiring the reader to know or learn any formal logic, or to use any computer proof assistant.},
