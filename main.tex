    Univalence and Higher inductive types are key structures in Homotopy Type Theory. Higher inductive types allow types to be inductively
     defined not just by points, but by paths and higher paths as well provides a powerful tool for the study of synthetic homotopy theory. 
     Types that represent spaces such as the interval, circle, torus and higher cell complexes can be defined with a concise framework. 
     Univalence formalizes the ubiquitous, but informal, mathematical practice of identifying isomorphic structures. This thesis explores
     an extension of sHoTT with the directed notions of these key structures: we study an extension of sHoTT with \textit{directed higher inductive types}
     and \textit{directed univalence}.

\section*{\centering 1. HoTT}
In HoTT, types are intuitively seen as $\infty$-groupiods. With this interpretation of a type, the path type between two terms, denoted $$x =_A y$$ represent a morphism in the groupoid. This is the correct notion, as familiar facts about equality are
reflected in the groupoid. That means reflexivity becomes the term $$\refl{x} : x=_A x,$$ which is interpreted as the identity morphism $$\id{x} : x \to_A x.$$ Given a path $$p : x =_A y,$$ we can take its inverse $$p^{-1} : y =_A x.$$ Similarly, a morphism $$f : x \to_A y$$ in a groupoid is invertible. Moreover, given another path $$q : y =_A z$$ we can form the concatenation $$q \cdot p : x =_A z.$$ We can similarly compose two morphisms in our groupoid. While this analogy extends far, this section only provides a basic overview of the facts of HoTT we'll eventually use in our study of directed higher inductive types. For a deeper dive, check [HoTT Book].

Simplicial homotopy type theory extends HoTT with \textit{extension types} and two extra layers, turning it into a
 \textit{type theory with shapes}. It is specialized to the case of a cube $\mathbbm{2}$ and an inequality tope, including rules making the tope layer the coherent logic of a strict interval. The top geometric layers interact with the bottom type theory layer
 through extension types. Extension types allow us to introduce dependent functions whose domain is a shape. To introduce an extension type, a shape that includes into the domain shape, a term that depends on that shape must be provided. Then, the extension
 type can be thought of as extending the provided section from a partial domain to a full domain. 

 With extension types in tow, we can probe simplicial shapes in types. That is, we can probe morphisms, 2-morphisms, 3-morphisms and higher by defining the right extension type. Using familiar notions from HoTT, we can then define a class of types whose morphisms have a weak composition structure, \textit{Segal types}. Segal types are a useful model of the notion of category. We can also define a type of classes that has no interesting simplicial data. These types are ones where the path types and morphism types are equivalent, they are dubbed \textit{discrete types}. Extending this further, types whose \textit{isomorphisms} are equivalent to its paths are dubbed \textit{Rezk types}. 


We can also reflect our situation in HoTT in sHoTT. In HoTT, all type families are fibrations. In sHoTT, \textit{some} type families are fibrations. We can define the type of type families that lift morphisms covariantly and contravariantly, which are aptly dubbed \textit{covariant} and \textit{contravariant type families}. We are not limited to lifting morphisms, we call families that lift 2-morphisms \textit{inner type families}. 

As mentioned before, we are working in a bespoke simplicial homotopy type theory. Included in our extended sHoTT is a segal classifying universe of covariant fibrations. We also include a directed univalence axiom which allows us to turn morphisms between discrete types into functions between them. 

In this section, we give an informal introduction to sHoTT and develop machinery for use in Section 4.
